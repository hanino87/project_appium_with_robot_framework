### BBD Driven Testcases 

The plan is to create and write the testcase according to Robot Frameworks BBD(Behavior Driven Development). 

The purpose is to write testcase so it`s clear that they releates directly relates to user acceptance criteria. 

The Given-When-Then syntax is a commonly used structure for writing user stories and acceptance criteria in behavior-driven development (BDD). It is used to describe the desired behavior of a system in a clear, concise, and consistent manner.
